  The figo Connect API allows you to easily access your bank account including transaction history and submitting payments.
  For a general introduction to figo and figo Connect please visit http://figo.io/.

  Albeit figo offers an interface to submit wire transfers, payment processing is not our focus. Our main interest is bringing peoples bank accounts into applications allowing a more seamless and rich user experience.
